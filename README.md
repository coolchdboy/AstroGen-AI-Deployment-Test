AstroGen AI is an astrological web application that generates personalized astrological insights based on a user's birth details. By utilizing machine learning models, it combines the birth chart of a user with relevant astrological knowledge stored in a FAISS vector store. The insights are derived from querying large language models (LLMs) using Langchain.

## Features

- Generate personalized birth charts based on user data (name, date of birth, time of birth, place of birth, gender).
- Retrieve astrological insights using a document retrieval chain powered by FAISS and Langchain.
- Display birth chart details, planetary effects, and astrological interpretations.
- Built using a Flask backend, with an intuitive HTML/CSS frontend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and folders:

```
AstroGen-AI/
│
├── app.py                     # Flask application
├── birth_chart.py             # Birth chart logic and planetary assignments
├── embedding.py               # FAISS vector embeddings
├── vector_embedding.pkl       # Pre-generated FAISS vector embeddings
├── requirements.txt           # Project dependencies
├── templates/

│   ├── index.html             # Form and response page template
│   ├── styles.css             # CSS styles for frontend
├── knowledge_base/
│   └── Pt. Radhakrishna ...   # Reference document (PDF)
```

### 1. **app.py**
This file is the core of the application, defining the Flask web framework and handling all API routes and logical workflows. The user interacts with the app via HTML forms, providing birth details and their astrological query. Once submitted, the app processes the data, generates the birth chart, retrieves relevant documents, and provides a personalized astrological response.

### 2. **birth_chart.py**
This module handles the generation of the birth chart, planetary positioning, and calculating their effects based on astrological principles. It defines classes for `Planet`, `House`, and `BirthChart`, and provides methods to assign planets to houses and calculate their impact.

### 3. **embedding.py**
This file contains the pre-calculated vector embeddings that store knowledge base information relevant to astrology, including literature and documents. The embeddings are used to fetch and retrieve information for the machine learning model to process and respond to the user's query.

### 4. **Templates (HTML Files)**:
The `templates/` folder contains HTML files that define the user interface for the web application.

- **home.html**: The welcome page where users are introduced to the app and directed to the astrological insights form.
- **index.html**: The main form page where users enter their birth details and astrological query. It also handles displaying the results including the birth chart, planetary effects, and a response generated by the AI model.

### 5. **styles.css**
This file contains custom CSS used for styling the web pages. It enhances the appearance of the application by providing a modern, clean UI.


## Technologies Used

### 1. **Flask**
   - Flask is used to build the web application backend, manage user input, and serve HTML templates for the frontend.

### 2. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**
   - FAISS is used as a vector store to store astrological document embeddings, which are later retrieved for generating relevant insights based on the user's astrological query.

### 3. **Langchain**
   - Langchain is used to create the document retrieval chain that processes user queries and integrates the knowledge stored in the FAISS vector store to generate relevant responses using the LLM (Large Language Model).

### 4. **HTML/CSS**
   - The frontend of the application is built with HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Bootstrap 5 is also used to enhance the UI's responsiveness and styling.

### 5. **Bootstrap**
   - Bootstrap 5 is used for a responsive and clean user interface, providing easy navigation for users across different devices.

### 6. **JavaScript/jQuery**
   - JavaScript is used to handle asynchronous requests and dynamically update the content of the page based on the server's responses, making the user experience more seamless.

### 7. **Python**
   - Python powers the backend logic of the application, from generating the astrological birth chart to managing the FAISS vector store and Langchain integrations.

## How It Works

1. **Birth Chart Generation:**
   - The app uses user input such as date of birth, time, and place of birth to generate a birth chart. This chart is computed based on predefined planetary positions and relationships.
   
2. **FAISS Document Retrieval:**
   - Pre-embedded astrological documents are stored in a FAISS vector store. When a user asks an astrological query, the vector store retrieves the most relevant documents.

3. **Langchain and LLM Insights:**
   - The Langchain library is used to build a retrieval chain that processes the user's astrological query. The chain retrieves relevant documents from the FAISS store, combines them with the user's birth chart, and queries an LLM to provide a detailed astrological insight.
